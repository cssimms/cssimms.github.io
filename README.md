# Personal Webpage

*Upadate*
  I'm currently in the process of re-working my person website.
  It's hard to 1 find time outside of working fulltime, and 2 to make an entire site that should be bragging about me.
  We'll see how it goes. Originally copied from HTML5 UP, but going to gut the whole thing and work from there.

Excluding small tweaks for my personal use, credit for this beautiful template goes to HTML5 UP, read below for more details.

Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
